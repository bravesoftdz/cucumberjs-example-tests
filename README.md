# cucumberjs-example-tests

An example project using the CucumberJS library.

Once you've installed node, and have checked out the code, change into the code directory and type:

    npm install
    
This will install all of the required libraries. Then run the tests with:

    npm test
    
There is a single included feature test which will do a search on a clothing site.
